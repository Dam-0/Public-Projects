# random projects

 a place where i put my random stuff i make for personal use


 ## GIAS (GUI Is A Sin)

**GIAS** is a terminal gui app that im making because I want to.
It is written in `rust` as I am learning it.

 You can find **GIAS** in the release tab
 or you can compile it yourself, I will not explain
 how to do this (for the time being) because it should be straight forward if you are the type of person that 
 wants to build from source.

 Current Verrsion `0.1`

### Libraries used

- [terminal-menu-rs](https://gitlab.com/xamn/terminal-menu-rs)
- [nixinfo](https://github.com/Dam-0/nixinfo) (I'm using my varitation of this library for purpose of a custom error msg)


 ## Compatibilty

 Most projects/ scripts/ stuff in this mess of a repo has only
 been tested on linux enviroments (Arch, ubuntu).
 I will not be making these work for windows if they dont already because a windows dev enviroments is just #%@$ and is #%@$ to setup.
