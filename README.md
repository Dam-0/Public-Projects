# random projects

 a place where i put my random stuff i make for personal use


 ## GIAS (GUI Is A Sin)

 You can find **GIAS** in the release tab
 or you can compile it yourself, I wont explain
 how to do this because it should be straight forward
 if your the type of person that wants to build
 from source

 Current Verrsion `0.1`


 ## Compatibilty

 Most projects/ scripts/ stuff in this mess of a repo has only
 been tested on linux enviroments (Arch, ubuntu).
 I will not be making these work for windows if they dont already because a windows dev enviroments is just #%@$ and is #%@$ to setup.
